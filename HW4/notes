Normal:
-Specify mean, sd, and number of bins and then construct approximation
Bins:
-try to cut down on number of bins


Drake Equation:
Some terms are not probabilities
Ultimate result is estimate of number of plants that support intelligent life
-Idea of uncertaintity around elements
-actual value falls in range
N is single number, but will end up being distribution, expected value is N
-look at other estimates on internet, intuition, justify what distribution
ex: variable L
-hard to say for sure, we have been able to send signals for over 100 years
-come up with statement of belief with rationale
ex: fp
-maybe continous between .8 and 1
-maybe norm distribution

For barchart,
probably sample from distribution and then use seaborn
